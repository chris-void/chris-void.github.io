## About u

When I was sitting on the bus travelling on the bus, I had no idea it might be the strangest and hardest time I ever had. Listening to Officially Missing U, watching the rain drops slowly fell across the window, I started to miss u. The memory of the dates we had crashed into my mind, I couldn't stop thinking about the thing between us. Honestly, I don't know if it was true, that the crossing-country thing is the only gap between u and me. I don't know that what I am in your thought, or I should say that I was too scared to know. And I don't have the courage to figure it out, although I always told myself that it was and is what I should do. Bothering u about these things is only a matter of trouble. And I should bear them with myself, it is my job to deal with that.
