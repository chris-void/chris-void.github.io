## Reasons

Recently I am involved in some open source project in Python. Specifically, [OpenStack/Swift](). And in a forseeing future, I may involve in more projects related with Python, especially Python is powerful language only with a solvable performance issue, which is actully meaning that rewriting part of the project in C lang will make it go away. This triggers the creation of this article.


## First of all, some experence and advice

If you are just start to use and learn Python, strongly recommand the [LPTHW]() and another blog I wrote. After finished those materials, one thing that you should always keep in mind is: ALWAYS USE VIRTUALENV. I don't think I need to remind you how messy it will be if you try to constantly modifying and changing Python version or installing packages using [pip] can be how annoying. Never try to use directly access Python unless you are working some small Python programs. **Use virtualenv. And use it well.**

## Learn from the best

Generally speaking, OpenStack/Swift is the first big ass Python project I
try to work on. Although I have read some code from other large Python wrote projects, it is the first time I try to fix a bug and thus, I have to figure out the way it works by myself. The philosify in Swift is a treasure to me and I am still benefiting from it. So, remember to contributing or modify some real life open source Python projects, so that you can learn from the best.

## Always remember to doc

After all, I am not saying that Python should be your goto choice for all your work or start a PL war. Python is a powerful lang, jsut like C or Java. **Use it well.** Kindfully remind you, use the coding style you choose and do documentations especially when you are contributing to some open source projects.
